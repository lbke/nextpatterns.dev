# Welcome to NextPatterns

NextPatterns is a course based on exercises. 
I describe a problem and how to fix it, and then you can practice on a real application.

If you are not in the mood for practice, 
you can jump straight to the solution.

You don't need to install anything on your computer.
NextPatterns relies on [WebContainers](https://webcontainers.io/) via the [TutorialKit framework](https://tutorialkit.dev/), 
a wonderful piece of technology that allows us run fullstack applications directly in your browser.

Take a few minutes to explore the user interface.

You'll find the following:
- A code editor with code samples demonstrating the problem we want to solve.
- A button to check the solution.
- A preview of a running Next application (it can take some time to load and start).

The code is merged into a running Astro application, 
and the result is what you see in the preview section.

You can edit the code and see the changes happen in real-time!

Now that you're more familiar with the interface, 
let's move on to the first pattern: 
properly streaming files in Next.js route handlers.

> NextPatterns is currently in its beta-test phase.
