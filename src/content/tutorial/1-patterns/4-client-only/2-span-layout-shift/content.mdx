# No layout shift for inline elements

Layout shift happens when an element of the page appears 
after a loading period
and no space was reserved for it.

This is a well known issue with images: 
the image source takes a few milliseconds to be downloaded by the browser,
and then suddenly pops up in the page moving all content around it.

Web auditing tools like Google Lighthouse can compute a Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
You'll want to keep the CLS as small as possible.

**Let's observe a shift induced by displaying data
that are fetched client-side.**

## Example: displaying a view counter

Let's say that you own a beautiful personal blog.
You want to display a visitor count on top of your article.

This data is provided by an API,
so you trigger an HTTP request to get the view count,
and then display it. Sadly, this creates a layout shift,
as seen in the code demo. 

Click the reload button in the preview (<i class="i-ph-arrow-clockwise inline-block"/>) to see the shift.

## A possible fix: reserve some space for the span

Layout shift can be provoked by any kind of HTML element.
In this example, we focus on inline text elements, like `<span>`

To prevent a layout shift, rather than rendering nothing,
we can render an empty span element with no content.

Sadly, a totally empty span has no height.
So instead, we need to render a span with dummy content,
and make it invisible during loading.

Jump to the practice section,
or click the "solve" button to see the result.


## üî® Practice: a "NoShiftClientOnlySan" component

import SkipPractice from "@/components/SkipPractice.mdx"

<SkipPractice />

- Create a component named `NoShiftClientOnlySpan`
- Import the `useClient` hook from "@/hooks/useClient"
- If `useClient` returns false, render an invisible span: `<span style={{ opacity: 0 }}>{"| "}</span>`
- If `useClient` returns true, return a span containing the children

Thanks to the span of opacity 0 and containing a single "|" character (a vertical bar),
some space is reserved for your text content until it actually loads.


## üßê Advanced solution: server-side data fetching

Another way to prevent a layout shift is to load the view count server-side.
This will remove the need for a client-side fetch call in the first place.

There is no layout shift for data that are already present in the HTML tree
after a server-render.

There are a few different ways to achieve that in Next.js :

- Get the visitor count from a React Server Component. 

Keep in mind that fetching dynamic data like a view count
may make the whole page dynamically rendered, for every request.

- Get the visitor count from a React Server Component 
and pass them to a client-side data fetching library.

For instance [SWR has a fallback attribute](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/with-nextjs#pre-rendering-with-default-data) to achieve that.
More broadly

- Get the visitor count from a React Server Component and enable Partial Prerendering (PPR).
The visitor count will be rendered on every request, 
but the rest of the page will stay static!
However this will involve a loading time client-side, so you'll still have to fix the layout shift.

- Keep your data fetching call client-side. It's fine!
