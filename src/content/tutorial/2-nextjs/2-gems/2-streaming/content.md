# Streaming files in Next.js App Router


It's very common to allow the users of a website to download static files.

Images are the most common type of static files, your website probably have a logo or a picture somewhere on the homepage.
You may want to share your CV in PDF format, your startup pitch deck, the recipe for the best lasagna...

The `/public` folder of Next.js apps allows sharing of static files. 
But as the name implies, files in this folder are totally public: this doesn't fit all use cases.

## Advanced scenarios with route handlers

This pattern will allow you cover the following advanced use cases:

- Private files: You may want to check some permissions before serving "extremely_confidential_report.docx".
- Personalized files: A generic url "/user/profile-picture" may serve a different image depending on the currently logged-in user.
- Generated files: The State of JavaScript survey backoffice app can generate CSV exports of the responses to the survey. This means we generate the file on the fly depending on the selected survey when we receive an export request.

We can't use the `/public` folder for that, we have to craft a more elaborate API endpoint to serve the files.
In Next.js App Router, we call API endpoints "Route Handlers".

> **Warning:** this exercise consists of adding a single line into the code, but don't be fooled: this is considered a very difficult pattern!

- If you are not yet familiar with Route Handlers, start by reading the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers).
- Read the documentation for [Node.js `filehandle.readableWebStream`](https://nodejs.org/docs/v20.16.0/api/fs.html#filehandlereadablewebstreamoptions)
- Use this function to transform the file stream into a webstream. **You will need the "bytes" option.**.
- The image should appear on the website.

using a custom function. Special thank to [Karl Horky](https://github.com/karlhorky) for showing me a simpler approach.
